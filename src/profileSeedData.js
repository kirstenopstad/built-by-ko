  background: [`Hi! I'm Kirsten. I'm passionate about building things that solve real-world problems.`,
    `Bringing fifteen years of design experience to a new chapter of my career, my specialty is translating complex technical concepts to collaborators so that the whole team can weigh trade-offs and make smart, sustainable choices together. I have a proven track record of taking projects from conceptual ideas to technical deliverables.`,
    // `After years of developing web products as side projects, I am now focused on codifying & intentionally applying those technical skills as a central part of my career. I've earned certifications in Computer Science and Full Stack Software Engineering â€“ and continue to actively grow those skills every week.`,
    `As a huge fan of Brene Brown's work around "living into our values," in the workplace and in one's personal life; and, in the spirit of vulnerability, I share my core values to give a sense of who I am and what's important to me:`,
    `1. Intentionality`,
    `2. Authenticity`,
    `3. Creativity`,
    `I live in Los Angeles with my wife and musical instruments. To get in touch, email me.`],
