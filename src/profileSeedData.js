  background: `Hi! I'm Kirsten. I'm currently enrolled in a full time, full stack engineering program at Epicodus.
    I am passionate about building things that solve real-world problems.
    Bringing fourteen years of design experience to a new chapter of my career. As a designer, my specialty is translating complex techincal concepts to collaborators so that the whole team can weigh trade-offs and make smart, sustainable choices together. As an engineer, I apply years of collaborative problem solving to a new workflow.
    As a huge fan of Brene Brown's work around Living Into Our Values, in the workplace and in one's personal life; and, in the spirit of vulnerability, I share my core values to give a sense of who I am and what's important to me:
    Intentionality
    Authenticity
    Creativity
    I live in Los Angeles and enjoy soup. To get in touch, email me.`,
